    "prompt": "High priced education is failing. Students are going to trade and technical schools, focused on training for jobs that can earn positive return on investment. Marketing, distributing, schooling, and hiring related to trade/technical schools win.",
    "explanation": "College students overloaded with debt from Ivey League universities are seeing tradespeople earning more disposable income, in addition the values of prestigious universities are being questioned forcing hiring managers to open their searches elsewhere. Students are increasingly opting for trade and technical schools that offer direct paths to employment with a positive return on investment. This shift supports growth in marketing, distribution, schooling infrastructure, and job placement services related to technical education. As demand for skilled trades rises, these sectors are well-positioned for significant growth, reflecting a pragmatic shift in the education landscape.",
